#jQuery Image Slider

The jQuery Image Slider is a piece of jQuery code I produced during the second year of my [IMD Course](http://imdweb.infj.ulst.ac.uk/). It came about because whilst I wanted to make use of large images, it was typically frowned upon as being used for 'filler' on the site. To that end I came up with a method to load in large images whilst not showing the full piece to the user until they decided to view it.

Whilst it started out as a very rough and ready (and admittedly sloppy) piece of code, I have cleaned it up somewhat and made sure that it works in as flexible a manner as possible. This is something I intend to continue in the future.

v0.5 - added some method of plugin jquery.
v0.4 - Cleaned up performance of code.
v0.3 - Improved functionality of plugin, made it easier to use, and started making use of the HTML5 ability to use data- to create custom attributes to HTML elements.
v0.2 - Added support for other elements than div (mainly for support of the html5 figure element) [released on web & github]
v0.1 - Converted from raw jQuery to a jQuery Plugin [released on web]
v0.0 - Basic Functionality for personal use
